## Functions

```tsx:getAllTransformersThreeWindings

export const getAllTransformersThreeWindings = async (
  limit = 10,
  page = 1,
  query = "",
  columns: IColumn[]
): Promise<{
  data: ITransformersThreeWinding[];
  status: number;
  totalPages: number;
  totalDocuments: number;
  completeData: ITransformersThreeWinding[];
}> => {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to retrieve TransformersThreeWindings based on parameters
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};

```
This function retrieves TransformersThreeWindings from the database based on specified criteria such as pagination, search query, and columns to display. It returns paginated results along with total counts and complete data matching the query.

```tsx:createTransformersThreeWinding

export const createTransformersThreeWinding = async (req: ICreateUpdateParams, userId: string) => {
  const { defaultFields, additionalFields } = req;
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to create a new TransformersThreeWinding
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};
 

```
This function creates a new TransformersThreeWinding in the database using the provided parameters, including default and additional fields. It logs the creation of the new record in the modification history and returns the newly created TransformersThreeWinding.

```tsx:getTransformersThreeWindingById

export const getTransformersThreeWindingById = async (id: string) => {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to retrieve a TransformersThreeWinding by its ID
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};


```
This function fetches a specific TransformersThreeWinding from the database by its unique ID. If the TransformersThreeWinding exists, it returns its details; otherwise, it returns a "not found" message.

```tsx:updateTransformersThreeWinding

export const updateTransformersThreeWinding = async (req: ICreateUpdateParams, id: string, userId: string) => {
  const { defaultFields, additionalFields } = req;
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to update a TransformersThreeWinding
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};

```

This function updates an existing TransformersThreeWinding in the database based on the provided parameters. It logs the changes made to the TransformersThreeWinding in the modification history and returns the updated TransformersThreeWinding.

```tsx:deleteTransformersThreeWinding

export const deleteTransformersThreeWinding = async (id: string, path: string, userId: string) => {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to delete a TransformersThreeWinding
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};

```
This function deletes a TransformersThreeWinding from the database by its ID. It also logs the deletion in the modification history and revalidates the specified path, presumably for cache invalidation.

```tsx:uploadTransformersThreeWindingFromExcel

export const uploadTransformersThreeWindingFromExcel = async (data: any, userId: string) => {
  try {
    await connectToDatabase();
    // Implementation code to upload TransformersThreeWindings from an Excel file
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(typeof error === "string" ? error : JSON.stringify(error));
  }
};

```
This function uploads TransformersThreeWindings from an Excel file into the database. It inserts the data from the file into the TransformersThreeWinding collection and logs the upload in the modification history.

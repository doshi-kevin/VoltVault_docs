The FormSkeleton component renders a skeleton loading UI for forms. It consists of a container with two sections: one for the form fields and another for the form actions. The form fields section contains placeholders for eight fields, each with a short and a longer placeholder represented by Skeleton components. The form actions section contains placeholders for two buttons. This skeleton UI gives users a visual indication of form structure and loading progress.

## Setting up environment variables

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

The app directory
For new applications, we recommend using the App Router. This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the Pages Router based on community feedback.
In the root folder of the application, create an env file and name it **.env**.

```tsx:.env showLineNumbers
MONGODB_URI=

UPLOADTHING_SECRET=
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=

NODE_ENV=
MONGODB_URL=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

BASE_URL=
```
Add the respective environment variable values.

## Run the Development Server

- Run 
```bash
npm run dev
```
to start the Development server
- Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.
-You will be automatically redirected to the login page of the system.

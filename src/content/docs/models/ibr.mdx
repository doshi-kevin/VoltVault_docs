    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {

```

This code defines a Mongoose schema called ibrSchema for an IBR (Interruptible Load) entity, primarily comprising an ID field and additional customizable fields. It supports complex attributes using Schema.Types.Mixed and enables real-time change stream monitoring. The model IBR is exported for database interactions, ensuring consistency in data handling.

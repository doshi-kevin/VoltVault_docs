```tsx:shuntCapacitorSchema

const shuntCapacitorSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    deviceName: {
      type: String,
    },
    busFrom: {
      type: String,
    },
    busSectionFrom: {
      type: String,
    },
    kv: {
      type: String,

```
This script defines a Mongoose schema for representing shunt capacitors in a database. It includes fields for device name, bus connection details, and electrical specifications like voltage and apparent power. The schema allows for additional custom fields and enables change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The exported model, ShuntCapacitor, facilitates CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection containing shunt capacitor data.
